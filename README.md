# Suncorp - Technical Challenge

In the realm of Workers' Compensation, efficient and accurate claims processing is crucial for maintaining financial stability and ensuring customer satisfaction. Suncorp recognizes the importance of leveraging Data Science to enhance the claims management processes. As a Data Scientist, my primary objective is to identify and implement opportunities to improve the accuracy and efficiency of their claims handling procedures.

The current manual process employed by their claims handlers involves extensive time and effort to review claim characteristics and estimate costs. These estimates significantly impact their financial reserves and must be precise and consistent. Unfortunately, the existing system often falls short in these areas, necessitating frequent adjustments. Additionally, the identification and triaging of complex claims pose significant challenges, often resulting in delays and suboptimal handling.
To address these issues, I have undertaken a comprehensive analysis of historical claims data, aiming to develop a data-driven solution that enhances their claims estimation accuracy and streamlines the identification of complex claims. This initiative is supported by a dataset provided by the business, which contains valuable insights from past claims.

In this PPT, I will outline the steps taken to analyze the dataset, develop predictive models, and derive actionable insights. The objective is to showcase how Data Science methods can be applied to revolutionize their claims processes, thereby improving efficiency, accuracy, and overall service quality. The findings and recommendations will be presented to the business owner and their technical advisor, highlighting the potential impact and benefits of the proposed solutions.
By leveraging advanced analytical techniques and machine learning models, I aim to transform their claims handling approach, ensuring timely and accurate estimations while efficiently managing complex claims. This endeavor underscores their commitment to innovation and continuous improvement in delivering superior Workers' Compensation services at Suncorp.



### Task 1

Our claims handlers spend a lot of time going through the claims characteristics and put cost estimates in the system. It is important that we get accurate estimates because these impact our reserves. Our estimates today are not very accurate and consistent and we have to modify them regularly.

### Task 2

It is very hard to identify complex claims and triage them to the right people. It would be nice if we can detect these complex claims early and get them to the right claims handlers to manage.
